Air Kerma must be measured 65 cm from the
radiation source


This method assumes a cylindrical breast 
shape of homogeneous mixture where 
air kerma is measured from the 
radiation source. The method further 
provides different Al filtrations

Any spectrum can be used as long as
radiation source to isocenter distance 
is 65 cm

Assumes heterogeneous composition

where air kerma is measured 65 cm from 
radiation source
